"During most of the Golden Age, the humans who inhabited the Great Continent "
"were mostly Wesnothians, divided across various territories such as the "
"Northlands, Elensefar and the kingdom of Wesnoth itself. However, there was "
"once a time of great strife during which a new race of humans started to "
"appear from nowhere. They were the 'Aragwaithi', which meant 'noble' in "
"their native language.\n"
"\n"
"It has been since then rumored that they came from the Vast Sea to settle in "
"Wesnoth. They mostly lived as mercenaries in that time, until the Fall. "
"After that, they supposedly moved to the northmost lands of the Continent, "
"were the sands could not reach, and the green could survive.\n"
"\n"
"Albeit being humans, many of their customs and racial features are "
"incredibly different to the standards, to the point it puts them close to "
"elves in terms of their dexterity with bows. Their wisemen have a mastery of "
"magic not to be underestimated in the battlefield, for it has surprised and "
"overseded the best magi often."
